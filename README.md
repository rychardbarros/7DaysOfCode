üêç Objective will be to practice on the main data structures in the computing world.

## Introduction...
Data structures are ways that you can organize, store, and manipulate data in your program. They are extremely important because they allow the program to run efficiently and effectively, and can help save resources such as processing time and memory, which is critical in many types of applications.

# Day1
The challenge for the day is to implement a simplified version of a shopping list using arrays. The list should allow adding new items, removing items, and listing all items.

When adding a new item, the user must enter the name of the product and the desired quantity. When removing an item, the user must specify the name of the product. Finally, when listing all items, the list must display the product name and quantity in a readable format.

# Day2
Simply chained lists are dynamic data structures consisting of nodes. Each node in the list contains a value (or values) and a pointer to the next node.
The first node in the list is called the "head", while the last node in the list is called the "tail".(The challenge was made without "Tail")

The challenge for today is to implement a patient management system in a hospital using simply chained lists.
Each patient should have a name, an ID number, and the patient's current health status, such as "stable", "in intensive care", "critically ill", and so on.
The system must allow you to add new patients, remove patients, and list all patients in order of arrival.
