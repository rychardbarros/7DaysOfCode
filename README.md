üêç Objective will be to practice on the main data structures in the computing world.
<hr>

## Introduction...
Data structures are ways that you can organize, store, and manipulate data in your program. They are extremely important because they allow the program to run efficiently and effectively, and can help save resources such as processing time and memory, which is critical in many types of applications.

After that run the files in some python compiler of your preference!

# Day1
The challenge for the day is to implement a simplified version of a shopping list using arrays. The list should allow adding new items, removing items, and listing all items.

When adding a new item, the user must enter the name of the product and the desired quantity. When removing an item, the user must specify the name of the product. Finally, when listing all items, the list must display the product name and quantity in a readable format.

# Day2
Simply chained lists are dynamic data structures consisting of nodes. Each node in the list contains a value (or values) and a pointer to the next node.
The first node in the list is called the "head", while the last node in the list is called the "tail".(The challenge was made without "Tail")

The challenge for today is to implement a patient management system in a hospital using simply chained lists.
Each patient should have a name, an ID number, and the patient's current health status, such as "stable", "in intensive care", "critically ill", and so on.
The system must allow you to add new patients, remove patients, and list all patients in order of arrival.

# Day3
Today you will practice one more structure, the doubly chained list! First, let's understand what it means.

Doubly chained lists are similar to simply chained lists, but each node also has a pointer to the previous node, allowing bidirectional access to the elements.

The challenge for the day is to implement an inventory control system for a store using doubly chained lists. Each product must have a name, a barcode, a price and a stock quantity.

The system must allow you to add new products, remove products, update the stock quantity and list all products.

# Day4
Today you will practice one more structure: queueing! First, let's understand what they are.

Queues are data structures that follow the first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle. New elements are inserted at the end of the queue, and old elements are removed from the beginning of the queue.

Queues have two basic operations:

   * Enqueue (queue, i.e., add to the end of the queue);
   * Dequeue (unqueue, i.e., remove the first element from the queue).
   
The challenge for the day is to implement a simple queue to manage orders for a restaurant. Each order can be represented by a string with the name of the dish and the table at which it was made. The system should allow you to add new orders to the queue, remove orders that have already been delivered and list all orders in the order they were placed.

# Day5
Today you will practice another data structure, very similar to the row you saw yesterday: stacks! Let's understand what it means.

Stacks are data structures that follow the "last in, first out" principle (i.e. LIFO, last in, first out). New elements are inserted on top of the stack and old elements are removed from the top of the stack.

Stacks have two basic operations:

   * Push (adds an element to the top of the stack);
   * Pop (removes an element from the top of the stack).
   
The challenge of the day is to implement a simple stack to manage the books from "The Chronicles of Ice and Fire" (Game of Thrones) saga. Each book should have a name and the number of pages. The system must allow to add new books to the stack, remove books, show the book that is on top and list all the books in the stack.

# Day6
Today you will practice hashmaps, also known as dictionaries (or even objects), in various languages!

Hash tables are data structures that allow efficient storage and access of elements through a process of mapping keys to values using a hash function.

Today's challenge is to implement a scoring system for online games using a hashmap technique . Each player will have a username and an associated number of points, and the system should allow you to add new players, update the scores of existing players, remove players, and list all players in descending order of points, as well as determine which player is the winner.
